Files under gfx/* and sfx/* miss copyright/licensing, but upstream said in
http://www.freelists.org/archives/olofsonprojects/06-2008/msg00004.html

| Anyway, as of 0.5.1, the author of all sounds and graphics is yours
| truly, and the license is intended to be the same as for the game
| (non-engine code); that is GNU GPL v2.

This means Copyright (c) David Olofson, 2007 and GPL-2+
